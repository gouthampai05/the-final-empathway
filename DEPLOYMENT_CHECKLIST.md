# Blog Feature Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration (OPTIONAL for basic functionality)

**üéØ Blog editing works WITHOUT this migration!**
- ‚úÖ Create blogs
- ‚úÖ Edit blogs
- ‚úÖ Auto-save
- ‚úÖ Publish blogs
- ‚ùå Public viewing at `/blogs/[slug]` (requires migration)

**If you want public blog viewing**, run the slug migration:

```bash
# File location: supabase/migrations/add_blog_slug.sql
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Adds `slug` column to `blogs` table
- ‚úÖ Creates unique index for published blog slugs
- ‚úÖ Backfills slugs for existing blogs
- ‚úÖ Validates migration success
- ‚úÖ Enables public viewing at SEO-friendly URLs

**How to run:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/add_blog_slug.sql`
4. Paste and run
5. Verify success message in output

### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)
All required dependencies should already be installed:
- ‚úÖ `framer-motion` (already in use)
- ‚úÖ `date-fns` (already in use)
- ‚úÖ `lucide-react` (already in use)

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set (should already exist):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
```

## Testing

### 1. Test Blog Editor
- [ ] Create a new blog post
- [ ] Verify auto-save works (check status indicator)
- [ ] Save as draft
- [ ] Edit an existing blog
- [ ] **Verify content loads in editor** ‚ú® (this was the bug fix!)
- [ ] Publish a blog

### 2. Test Loading States
- [ ] Navigate to `/blogs` - should see CardLoader
- [ ] Click "New Blog" - should see EditorLoader
- [ ] All loaders should have smooth animations

### 3. Test Public Blog Viewing
- [ ] Publish a blog post
- [ ] Visit `/blogs/your-blog-slug`
- [ ] Verify reading progress bar works (scroll page)
- [ ] Test share buttons (copy link, social sharing)
- [ ] Check table of contents (desktop only, 1280px+)
- [ ] Test "Back" button navigation

### 4. Test ISR
- [ ] Visit a blog page twice (should be fast second time)
- [ ] Update a blog
- [ ] Wait 60 seconds
- [ ] Refresh blog page (should show updates)

### 5. Mobile Testing
- [ ] Blog list view responsive
- [ ] Blog reading page responsive
- [ ] Table of contents hidden on mobile
- [ ] Share buttons work
- [ ] Editor works on tablet/mobile

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Performance
- [ ] Blog pages load in < 1s (after ISR cache)
- [ ] No layout shift on loading
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60fps)

### SEO
- [ ] Blog pages have proper meta tags
- [ ] Open Graph tags present
- [ ] Twitter Card tags present
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3)

### Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader friendly
- [ ] Proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Color contrast sufficient

## Known Issues / Notes

### Database Schema
**Important:** The `slug` column must be added before deploying. Without it:
- ‚ùå Blog creation will fail
- ‚ùå Public viewing will not work
- ‚ùå ISR will not function

### Legacy Blogs
If you have existing blogs without slugs:
1. The migration will auto-generate slugs
2. Slugs are created from the title (lowercase, hyphenated)
3. Verify slugs are unique and readable
4. Manually update problematic slugs in Supabase dashboard if needed

### ISR Revalidation
- Default: 60 seconds
- To change: Update `export const revalidate = 60` in `app/blogs/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Lower = fresher content, higher = better cache performance

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### 1. Database Rollback
```sql
-- Remove slug column (if needed)
ALTER TABLE blogs DROP COLUMN slug;

-- Remove indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS blogs_slug_unique;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS blogs_slug_idx;
```

### 2. Code Rollback
The changes are backwards compatible. You can:
- Revert to previous commit
- All existing functionality still works
- Only new public viewing will be affected

## Support

### Documentation
- `docs/BLOG_FEATURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Full feature documentation
- `docs/feature-module-design.md` - Architecture patterns
